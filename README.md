# Restaurant Material App
from Google, by me, for everyone

Created using Java Swing and includes a database. This application uses a clean and beautiful theme, namely Material 2.0 created by Google. If you like it, use it, if not leave it. As simple as that.

Critics and suggestions will still be received for the development of this application, thank you.
